Todo:
  ✔ Review and reconsider schema @done(19-01-27 13:50)
  ✔ Consolidate `squares` and `squares-checkered` @done(21-09-27 16:58)
  ✔ Get rid of `tileLight` and `tileDark` and dynamically generat dark squares based on specified stroke colour @done(21-09-27 16:58)
  ✔ Figure out why patterns sometimes break @done(21-10-05 11:29)
  ✔ Make `stacking-offset` renderer rotate properly @done(21-11-13 09:14)
  ✔ Does the click handler need more granularity? Homeworlds is a good example. Is it ok if one click triggers multiple events? @done(21-12-10 09:03)
  ✔ Figure out what's up with the renderer occasionally expanding piece names like "B3E" into hexadecimal colour strings (e.g., Pikemen with AB player names). [SVG.js bug. Reported.] @done(21-12-18 13:51)
  ✘ Make `stacking-expanding` renderer rotate properly, including keys and captured pieces. @cancelled(21-12-10 09:03)
  ✔ Made column labels customizable and infinite. @done(21-12-20 18:12)
  ✘ Legend signifiers do not appear to be case sensitive (e.g., Cannon board tried to use "R" and "r" for soldiers and towns). See issue: https://github.com/svgdotjs/svg.js/issues/1242. Appears to be unrelated to SVG.js. @started(21-12-23 12:26) @cancelled(21-12-23 16:46) @wasted(4h20m57s)
  ✔ Produce more useful JSON schema validation error messages. @done(21-12-23 16:59)
  ✔ Make it possible to disable expanding `eject` annotations. @done(21-12-23 17:12)
  - Write proper tests
  - Pyramid rotation at odd angles clips a little (e.g., Pikemen).
  - Make the `squares-beveled` style actually look chiseled (drop shadow effects)
  - See if you can figure out why `board.markers` are not being interpreted properly in `src/renderers/_base.ts`, thus needing the blanket ESLint rule at the top of the file.
